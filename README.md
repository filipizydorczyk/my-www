This is repo with my website that is currently in development stage. It is going to look like this:

![](./mockups/main.png)
![](./mockups/portfolio.png)

# Build

-   `npm install` - install dependencies
-   `npm run build` - builds static html files
-   `npm run serve` - starts local server with last website build

# Code conduct

1. Each segment should be covered with `section` tag with `id`

```html
<section id="id"></section>
```

2. In code use camel case
